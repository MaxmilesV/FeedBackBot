# FeedBackBot
Feedback bot for Telegram, created for my friend.
It was my first experience with telegram bots and aiogram.

**To run this bot for yourself do this:**
1. In main.py change API_TOKEN variable to token of your bot.
2. By using SQL command insert your user id as admin to bot.
You can do this via consol or any aplication for SQL. I prefer DB Browser for SQLite.
Use this command: *INSERT INTO users (user_id, is_baned, is_admin) VALUES (YOUR_ID, 0, 0)*
Change YOUR_ID to your user id nember. You can get it from @userinfobot in telegram.
